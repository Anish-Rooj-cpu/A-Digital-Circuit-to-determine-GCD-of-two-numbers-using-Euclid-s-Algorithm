# A-Digital-Circuit-to-determine-GCD-of-two-numbers-using-Euclid-s-Algorithm
In this project, I have designed a Digital Circuit which calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two given numbers using Euclid's Algorithm. I have implemented the circuit using custom registers capable of changing and loading the contents of the register when appropriate signals are given.
